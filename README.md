# gARphics: A novel approach to viewing graphs in the AR space

## How to get it running
Firstly, install the [APK](https://github.com/Not-Pace/gARphics/blob/main/gARphics_app.apk) on your phone. Next, download the [marker image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Not-Pace/gARphics/main/media/marker.jpeg) from the repo as well. To have the graph appear on your screens, you'll need to have the marker image either printed out or displayed on a different device. Hold the marker in front of your camera after you've entered the .csv file into gARphics.

This current version only supports marker-based tracking in augmented reality. A future version would support markerless tracking (using an arbitrary user-defined marker to display graph).
